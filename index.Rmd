`r emo::ji("wave")` **Howdy!** I'm Matt and I `r emo::ji("heart")` working with data to solve problems! I am an adjunct professor in Geospatial Data Science `r emo::ji("world_map")` and ML in the [Masters of Urban Spatial Analytics](https://www.design.upenn.edu/musa/about) (MUSA) graduate program at the University of Pennsylvania. While my academic training `r emo::ji("books")` is in Quantitative Anthropology, most of skills have come from a diverse career working in industry from fieldwork `r emo::ji("man_farmer")` to global corporate digital strategy`r emo::ji("man_office_worker")` and directing technical solutions`r emo::ji("man_technologist")`. Mainly, I just love to write code to improve the world in whatever way I can!

When not looking at a screen, I am passionate about cooking, pasta making, BBQ/Smoking, and bread. To offset that passion, I am an avid runner ([Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2059383)) on road and trails, but more likely to be running after two small kids.
