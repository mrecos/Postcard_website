`r emo::ji("wave")`Hi! I'm Matt and I `r emo::ji("heart")`working with data to solve problems! I am an adjunct professor in Geospatial Data Science `r emo::ji("world_map")`and ML in the [Masters of Urban Spatial Analytics](https://www.design.upenn.edu/musa/about) (MUSA) graduate program at the University of Pennsylvania. While my academic training `r emo::ji("books")`is in Quantitative Anthropology, most of skills have come from a diverse career working in industry from fieldwork `r emo::ji("man_farmer")`to global corporate strategy`r emo::ji("man_office_worker")`and technical solutions`r emo::ji("man_technologist")`
